# 📰 Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting whether a news article is **fake or real** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning techniques**.  
It was developed in **Google Colab** as part of my learning and internship work in **AI & ML**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Preprocessed text data using **NLP techniques** (stopword removal, stemming, vectorization).  
- Built and trained ML models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**.  
- Evaluated model accuracy, precision, and recall for fake news detection.  
- Implemented in **Python (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML models, evaluation)  
- **NLTK** (text preprocessing)  
- **Google Colab** (development environment)
